THE COGMAC HIDPUNK LIBRARY:
HidPunk is a library for accessing Human Interface Devices (HID).  The HidPunk
API allows developers to create custom interfaces for a wide range of HID devices,
include mice, keyboards and joysticks; without having to write any C code.

Currently, the only implementation of the HidPunk API is written for 
OSX 10.4 or above.


BUILDING:
1. If the JNI code has been altered, you should first recompile the JNI library.  
Go to the "jni_src" directory and run "make".  Currently, only building from the
OSX platform is supported.  The make file should update the libhidpunk.jnilib 
file in the lib directory. 

2. Go to the project directory and run "ant".  


RUNTIME:
1. The HIDPUNK JNI libraries should be located somewhere in java.library.path. 
You may set this with the runtime parameter 
"java -Djava.library.path=<location_of_libs> <whatever else>".
